"""`The graph illustrates how BMI is distributed across a population, showing that a substantial number of individuals are in the overweight category, and there's a smaller but present group with obesity, while fewer individuals are underweight or in the lower end of the healthy weight range. The most frequent BMI values (the peak of the distribution) are somewhere between 25 and 30, suggesting that a significant portion of the population in this dataset falls into the "overweight" category (BMI 25-29.9 is generally considered overweight).`

`The boxplot is designed to visually demonstrate whether there's a difference in BMI levels between people who have diabetes and those who do not, and it appears to suggest that individuals with diabetes generally have higher BMIs. The median line in the right box (likely representing individuals with diabetes) appears to be higher than the median line in the left box (likely representing individuals without diabetes). This suggests that, on average, individuals with diabetes tend to have a higher BMI. Both groups appear to have a significant number of outliers, especially on the higher end of the BMI scale. This indicates that there are individuals in both groups with very high BMI values, some of which are considered extreme relative to their respective groups.`
